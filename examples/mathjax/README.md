# Render LaTeX in GitHub Pages with MathJax

This setup runs standardese and then processes the generated Markdown with
Jekyll like GitHub Pages does.  To start a local web server serving the
generated static HTML, run the following:

```
cd doc
make
```

This assumes that standardese and Ruby's [bundler](https://bundler.io/) are on
your path.
